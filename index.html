      <h2>The Beginning of a Legend</h2>

      <p>
        Howlin' Wolf was born in White Station, Mississippi on June 10, 1910 to Gertrude Jones and Leon "Dock" Burnett as Chester Arthur Burnett. The nickname "Howlin' Wolf" was given by Burnett's maternal grandfather, John Jones, due to Burnett's habit of recklessly squeezing his grandmother's chickens to death. Jones often warned Burnett that wolves in the area would get him, which earned him the family nickname "the Wolf". 
      </p>

      <p>
        Howlin' Wolf's musical journey unofficially began when he was very young, when he and his mother sang together in the choir of the Life Boat Baptist Church near Gibson, Mississippi. However, he did not officially start honing his craft until January 15, 1928, when he bought his first guitar at the age of 17. Throughout the '30s and '40s, he participated in both solo and group performances, all the while learning from many popular blues performers of the time. After enduring some legal troubles in the late '30s and spending some time in the U.S. Army in the early '40s, Howlin' Wolf formed his first band with Willie Johnson (guitarist), Matt "Guitar" Murphy (guitarist), Junior Parker (harmonicist), a pianist known only as "Destruction", and Willie Steele (drummer) in 1948.

      <h2>Building the Legend</h2>

      <p>
        Howlin' Wolf recorded his first album in 1951 after being discovered by talent scout Ike Turner in West Memphis. Shortly after, he became a local celebrity and then, in late 1952, he relocated to Chicago. There, Howlin' Wolf assembled a new band, the lineup of which changed often over the years.
      </p>

      <p>
        For the rest of the '50s and throughout the '60s and '70s, Howlin' Wolf went on to record 14 albums and a combination of 55 singles and EPs. During that time, he became one of the most influential blues musicians of all time. His style ranged from blues, rhythm and blues, rock and roll, and psychedelic rock. In addition to his records, he put on a large number of live performances, even touring Europe in 1964. He continued to perform live until November of 1975, despite his declining health. Just a matter of weeks later, on January 10, 1976, Howlin' Wolf died from a combination of a brain tumor, heart failure, and kidney disease. His body was buried in Oakridge Cemetery, where it remains to this day.

Its goal is to preserve the blues music genre, provide scholarships to allow students to participate in music programs, and support blues musicians and blues programs. At the time of writing, there is no current information on the foundation. However, Kelly is currently heading a crowdfunding campaign to establish the Chester "Howlin' Wolf" Burnett Artist-in-Residence Fund at Columbia College.
