      <figcaption>
        The polaroid of Howlin' Wolf pictured above was taken during an interview in a Toronto hotel room in 1970. Due to a faulty camera, this was the only shot from the interview that the interviewer, known as "The Oldie", was able to salvage. "The Oldie" jokingly commented that the flaws in the shot "give it a kind of funky grit."
