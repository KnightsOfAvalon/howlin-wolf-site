              This Web Design course significantly increased my confidence level with front-end web development. I have learned how to use HTML, CSS, and third-party tools to create an appealing web site from the ground up. Also, this course helped me exercise skills that will be useful in virtually any career in the Software Development field.

              This course helped me consider more options for future careers in the Software Development field. Since I am not a creative person, I always envisioned myself in a back-end or analytical role of some sort. After taking this course, however, I could possibly see myself in a front-end role. With third-party tools, trial-and-error, and lots of practice, there might be hope for me!

              Problem-solving was very much the over-arching theme of this course. From using the class server to working with unfamiliar technologies, road blocks occurred frequently. Sometimes the way past involved searching through my code for bugs. Sometimes it involved reviewing literature on the tools I was using. Still other times, it involved reaching out to my instructor and fellow students for help. In every case, I had to identify the block, formulate possible fixes, and then implement those fixes until I overcame the block.

              For the coding aspect of web design, the focus was HTML and CSS in this course. Not only did I practice coding in plain HTML and CSS, but I also learned how to use W3.CSS and Font Awesome to enhance my web pages even further.

              Although I brought some previous experience with file management into this course, I still had the opportunity to improve. My instructor, Professor Herd, noticed that I inappropriately put files in the root directory on one occassion. He quickly brought the issue to my attention so that I could properly organize and update my site links. After organizing those files, I saw how much nicer the end result looked compared to the original organization. That experience showed me that I can always improve even if I already have experience in a particular area.

              In a Web Design course, you might expect the skill "web design" to be higher on this list. However, the term "web design", in this sense, refers to the actual layout and styling of web pages. Therefore, the previously listed skills were necessary precursors to focusing on web design.

            <p>
              In terms of web design, I learned that I don't have to be a good artist to make visually appealing web pages. Resources such as W3.CSS and its accompanying documents give a major boost to less creative people (such as myself). Templates allowed me to pick and choose design features I liked without having to create them myself from scratch. Color choosers and color generators helped me create a whole theme from a couple of colors that I liked.

              This Web Design course provided a basic refresher for me on using Git and GitHub. I practiced making small and frequent commits and syncing the local and remote repositories regularly. I found that writing concise commit messages was the part of this process I struggled with the most. Breaking up commits helped me in this regard, but I know its still something I will have to keep practicing.

              My name is Avalon, but nearly everyone calls me Ava. I am 30 years old, a Navy veteran, a wife, and currently a stay-at-home mom to a wild little one-year-old. We have two adult family cats, Batman and Cookie. To explain the name choices, they already had those names at the shelter and we didn't want to confuse them by changing them. (Batman definitely lives up to his name, though. He's often found running and leaping throughout the house as if he's fighting invisible foes.)

              I have been a student of Software Development for about 2 years. I have participated in independent study programs in addition to traditional college-based study. Currently, I am working toward an AAS in Software Development at Dallas College.
            </p>
            <p>
              When I'm not busy being a mom or working on my degree, I love watching scary movies and "Let's Play" videos on YouTube. (Huge CoryXKenshin fan here!) I also play the occasional video game when I have the time, usually something from the Legend of Zelda series or something scary.
